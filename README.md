# Knowledge Sharing Platform üóí

Knowledge sharing platform application aims to get the students acquainted with the courses, professors, and evaluation schemes. The said things can be achieved via gathering course feedback, professor feedback, and previous year grading schemes. This can be done by making a portal (just like a blog site) where people can share their honest reviews without being scrutinized much. Getting reviews from the masses makes it easy for one to choose a particular course and get the right information about that course. Crowd-sourcing of materials and feedback would make it easy to organize resources in one place. It would be more reliable, save one‚Äôs time, and avoid unnecessary bothering. Moreover, students can also get relevant course resources from the students who already opted for the course. This platform can also act as a general guidance portal.
